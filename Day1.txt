- kubernets is container orchestation platform
- containers are Ephemeral in Nature
- Ephemeral means short in Nature 
- if all the containers are on one host and 1 container is taking all the resourses then other container suffer
- so PROBLEM No 1 is Having One host
- PROBLEM no 2 lets say someone killed a container then the applicatin in that container will not be accessible, so somebody has to act to start it
  so this behaviour is called Auto Healing (container will heal automatically)
- Auto Healing is missing in Docker
- PROBLEM No 3 is Auto scaling
